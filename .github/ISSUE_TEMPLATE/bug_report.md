**Set your log file level to debug, repeat the steps that cause the problem and post the debug infos ZIP which can be retrieved in the [System / Bugreport section](http://127.0.0.1:5076/system/bugreport). If other tools are involved post their logs as well.**

You don't have to follow the next steps by the letter, just think about what you're trying to achieve ;-) 

* What do you expect to happen? What does happen? 
* Have you searched for this problem? You don't have to answer, just make sure.
* Can the problem be reproduced? How?
* Use a proper title. Describe the problem succinctly, don't just copy and paste the error message.
* If you use a docker container please tell me which one.
* If there's a bug with the GUI post at least your current version, OS, resolution and browser and post a screenshot if necessary.

**I will close your issues if I you didn't provide proper information as described as above**

The more information you provide up front the higher the chance that I can help you.
