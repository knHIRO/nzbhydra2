  <h3 class="modal-title">Five years of NZBHydra!</h3>
</div>
<div class="modal-body" style="text-align: left">
  <p>On this day, five years ago I <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/3vna42/presenting_nzb_hydra_the_usenet_meta_search_alpha/" target="_blank">first showed NZBHydra to the public</a>.</p>
  
  <p>It was the product of months of hard work and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/mlVXMT9.png" target="_blank">butt-ugly</a>. I started it mostly just for fun and to see if I could - it was my first
    python project and it shows in the code. At that point the only other comparable tool was "NZBMegaSearch" which, to be honest, I already blew out of the water feature-wise, and was already abandoned.
    When I released hydra I thought "What features could I possibly add to this?". Well, apparently enough to put another two years of work and more than 1100 commits into it.</p>
  
  <p>But at some point I realized that I could barely keep it working and with every change I made I introduced bugs left and right and the performance got worse and worse.
    The most pressing issue were database timeouts which I never really solved.</p>
  
  <p>So I decided to switch to java (which I know by heart) and write NZBHydra2. I'd say that was another (at least) 600 hours of work just for the first release - which I <a
    href="https://old.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/7ojguw/first_public_release_of_nzbhydra2_better_faster/" target="_blank">published</a> three years ago in january.
    I think at that point it was one of the top 5 posts on /r/usenet.</p>
  <p>Five years later I've put more than 3000 hours into both projects, made 3300 commits and got 1100 stars on GitHub. I roughly estimate the user count to be somewhere in the 50 thousands - which is probably nothing compared
    to NZBGet or Sonarr but still, I never expected to reach these numbers.</p>
  <p>I admit that I'm burnt out a bit and the frequency of my commits waned - by now I *really* can't think of many more features to develop. That being said I have no plans of abandoning the project and will continue to fix bugs, answer
    questions and do improvements.
  </p>
  <p>
    I want to thank all users, all the people on reddit, on my discord server, the donors, the bug reporters, the feature requesters, the indexer admins and all the other developers in this little microcosm of ours.</p>
  <p>
    And last but not least I want to celebrate with you. For that I will give away a year's worth of "Ale" VIP access on <a href="https://drunkenslug.com/" target="_blank">DrunkenSlug</a> for ten users. If you don't have an account, don't
    worry - I'll send you an invite!
    Big thanks to the admin for providing me these give-aways, I really appreciate it. To participate just visit the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/nzbhydra/" target="_blank">NZBHydra subreddit</a> and look for the announcement thread.
  </p>

  ❤️, TheOtherP
